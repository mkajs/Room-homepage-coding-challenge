# Frontend Mentor - Room homepage

![Design preview for the Room homepage coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

See the live version using this [Link.](https://room-homepage-master-mkajs.netlify.app)

**I used `html`, `vanilla-javascrip`, `tailwind-css` as css framework and for compile and bundling i used `parcel`.**

## How to use

##### open your terminal and run this commands:

- Create an empty directory and initialize it with `npm install`
- Start developement server and modify it using `npm run start`
- Deploy ready to serve code for cdn by `npm run build`

For more information you can see `package.json` file.

Parcel will build and polifill css and js codes. It will minify all files and optimize them for serve in cdn services. In order to work in older browsers you can change `browserslist` in `package.json` file

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this e-commerce homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## Where to find everything

You can find design files in the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building project

As a paractice i have used `tailwind-css` for style elements only in `javascript` i was forced to use `css` to transform slides in x-axis.
The process of building this page is listed below:

1. Initialize project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share the code with the community. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Install dev dependencies like `tailwind` and `parcel`.
3. Configue the configue files and add `font`, `colors` and other changes to the default tailwind configue file as extends.
4. Look through the designs to start planning out how to tackle the project. This step is crucial to help think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles. I have decided to use absolote positioning for slides and percentage base values for the containers.
5. Structure html elements for gaining the bone of layout
6. Write more styles to make them responsive and hover states.

## Deploying your project

There are many ways to deploy your code to the internet. I used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and you can use any of cdn services. I have listed some of recomended ones below:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
